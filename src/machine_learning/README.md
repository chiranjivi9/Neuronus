# Neuronus ML Component - Key Eviction Strategy

This folder contains scripts and data for implementing an ML-based key eviction strategy in Neuronus. The goal is to predict which keys in the Neuronus key-value store should be evicted based on access patterns such as access frequency, size, and time-to-live (TTL).

## Steps

### Prerequisite 
1. **Generate Data**: 
   - The `generate_entries.py` script simulates random `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, and `EXPIRE` operations on the Neuronus key-value store.
   - It collects access patterns like access count, last accessed time, and key size into a file (`generated_analytics.json`) for later use in ML models.

2. **Simulate Operations**:
   - Run the script to simulate key operations and generate the dataset for ML preprocessing:
     ```bash
     python src/ml/generate_entries.py
     ```
   - This script will generate 5000 operations by default and save the analytics data in JSON format (`generated_analytics.json`).

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean and prepare the analytics data generated by generate_entries.py for training the ML model.
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Create meaningful features from the raw data to help the model make better predictions.
3. **Model Development**: 
   - Train a machine learning model to predict key eviction.
4. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Assess the modelâ€™s performance to ensure it's making accurate predictions.
5. **Model Integration**: 
   - Integrate the trained ML model back into Neuronus for real-time decision-making.
